# README of Modeling
- `obj1_arima.Rmd`: Build ARIMA model for objective 1. Use the data from 2006 to 2018 as the training set and the data from   2021 to 2023 as the test set. Plot the prediction and the confidence intervals(80% and 95%)for the number of calls in 2021 to 2023 using the model trained by the training set. Report the test error and plot the comparison line plot for the prediction result and test set. 

- `obj1_lstm.py`: This file contains code for modeling objective 1 using LSTM, which is used to predict call volume in next 3-5 years.

- `obj2_ARIMA_VAR_staff_count.py`: This file contains code for modeling objective 2 using ARIMA and VAR, which is used to predict the number of staff counts.

- `obj2_final_staff_counts.ipynb`: This file contains code for modeling objective 2, which is used to predict the number of staff counts.

- `obj2_SARIMA_room_hours.ipynb`: This file contains code for modeling part of objective 2 (predicting the number of monthly OC room hours). This code used SARIMA model to predict this aspect.

- `obj2_staff_counts.ipynb`: This file contains code for modeling objective 2, which is used to predict the number of staff counts.

- `obj3_line_items.ipy`: This file contains code for modeling KNN and plotting results of KNN and ARIMA for objective 3.

- `obj3_ARIMA_py.py`: This file contains code for modeling ARIMA for objective 3
